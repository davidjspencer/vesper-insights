					<h2>About the founder</h2>
					<p>Christina Roosen is the daughter of a doctor & a diplomat, which laid the foundation for her future career.. As a child she had a great desire to follow in her fathers footsteps and become a doctor, until the day she fainted by the sight of blood. She then pursued her studies and career in International Relations, which eventually led her to work for over a decade as a European executive in the world’s largest Health & IT membership organization.</p>
					<p>For many years, Christina managed some of the largest Health & IT conferences in Europe and built local communities in several European countries and regions. This role allowed her to grow an extensive network of influencers across Europe and also provided first hand exposure to best practices from around the world.</p>
					<p>Christina believes in ‘soft’ lobbying meaning that sometimes you need help to meet the right people, at the right place and at the right time. She founded Vesper Insights to help making those meetings happen as she saw that was the essential ingredient for change.</p>
